This is a TODO list app that allows a user to add todo list items via a form. The list items then appear on the opposite side of the page alongside a radio input. If the lower form is completed, and what the user enters is on the page, then it will cross that item out. If the radio input is clicked, it will delete the item from the page, and remove it from localStorage. LocalStorage is used so that if the page is refreshed, the information that was there before the refresh is still there.
